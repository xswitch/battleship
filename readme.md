Bugs


For tomorrow
> Polish table
>> fixed width, so boards stay the same size
>> clearer display of currently selected ship

> IF out of bounds, filter array and change only the ones within board to "invalid" class

> Split up functions, isolating functionality
>> placeShip - check if ship is already there

> Get images for ships
>> Split up image into as many parts as ships length
>>> Assign each part to each cell in turn
>>> When rotating ship, rotate images as well
