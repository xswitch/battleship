Bugs
> Reverse playing boards, currently player1 is shooting on his own ships and vice versa

For tomorrow
> Polish table

> IF out of bounds, filter array and change only the ones within board to "invalid" class

> Split up functions, isolating functionality
>> placeShip - check if ship is already there

Fixed 
- Preview stays if no ship is placed
- refactored placeShip() a bit
-
